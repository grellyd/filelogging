# FileLogging
## Go Logging library that pipes to both stdout and disk

Created as part of my contribution to our [CPSC 416 Project 2](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/teaching/cs416_2017w2/project2/index.html), filelogging is a custom logging package that can write to stdout and disk simultaneously. 

I extracted this package out as I wanted to use it in future projects.
